### Topic

Navigating the Risks: A Data-Driven Look at New York's Vehicle Collisions

### Intro

Across the bustling expanse of New York, traffic accidents are an all-too-common part of the cityscape, with a substantial number leading to critical injuries and loss of life. This persistent issue is highlighted by the New York State Department of Health, which reports motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of injury-related deaths in the state ([Car Accident Facts and Figures](https://www.scottgottlieblaw.com/car-accident-lawyer/facts-figures/), 2021). Although the [data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes) from recent years indicates a downward trend in collision numbers, the injuries and fatalities remain distressingly high. In the year 2022 alone, 51,928 New Yorkers were injured and nearly 300 lives were lost due to vehicular accidents. An examination of over two million collision records paints a  picture of these incidents, revealing the daily risks and the imperative for safer travel narratives throughout New York.

### Dataset

The data is found at: [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes)

Since the original data has a lot of N/A values in some columns and repetitive fields, I did some data cleaning and initial EDA to get the new filtered dataset, adding additional variables for more efficient analysis and visualization. 

Here is part of the process of data processing with Python.

Here is the basic information about the filtered dataset.

Complete filtered dataset used in this project can be found at [filtered data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12FEnHLSqzG-Lvxcs3yNbyBPDKON6DXkr/view?usp=drive_link). The data cannot be uploaded to the Github repository since it is too large.

I will explore the relationships among these variables to figure out the pattern of collision numbers by year, region, season, hour, etc. The following is my outline that details how I will use this dataset.

# Outline

## Background introduction

### Yearly overview
Present a visual comparison of yearly collision numbers against injuries and fatalities from 2012 to 2022. Highlight the disparity between the declining collision numbers and the stubbornly high casualty figures -- each crash now seems to have more serious consequences than the previous one.

### Regional analysis

Use a map to illustrate collision hotspots in New York. Discuss the frequency of accidents in different regions and highlight the most dangerous streets and intersections.

## **Collision Patterns**

### Hourly distribution

Provide a visualization showing collision frequency by hour. Emphasize the risks associated with rush hours and the relative calm of the late-night hours.

### Daily dynamics

Display a visualization of collision numbers by weekday: starting Monday, collision numbers rise, peaking on Friday, followed by a weekend decline. Discuss possible reasons for this pattern.

### Seasonal variations

Display the seasonal pattern of collision numbers: more frequent collisions in summer and fall while less frequent collisions in winter, noting the anomaly of the 2020-21 season.

### Collisions by vehicle types

List visualization of top vehicles most frequently involved in collisions and discuss any patterns or surprises in this data.

> The top 6 vehicle types most freqeunty associated with car accidents are Station wagon / sport unitility vehicle, sedan, passanger vehicle, taxi, pick-up taxi, and van.

> Of these six major vehicle types, sedans and station wagons/sport utility vehicles were the ones involved in the most crashes over the past six years.

Will also include some news and reports from other sources to make the discussion more intuitive in this part. e.g. [Car Accident Facts and Figures](https://www.scottgottlieblaw.com/car-accident-lawyer/facts-figures/).

## Consequences -- the human cost

Present the numbers of injured and killed in a clear format. Break down these figures into pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists to highlight the varying degrees of vulnerability.

## Conclusion & Call to action

The analysis navigated the when, where, and how of New York's vehicle collisions. The patterns uncovered are not mere statisticsâ€”they're calls for heightened awareness and preventative action. 

Data informs change. Let this analysis be a catalyst for enhanced safety measures, targeted education, and impactful policy reforms, steering towards a future where New York's streets are not just vibrant, but also safer for all.

# Method and medium
I will be using Shorthand to create the story of a vehicle collision in New York, which will include all of my finalized visualization works using Tableau, Canva, and probably Figma.
