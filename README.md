# About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mingyu Zhang, and I'm currently a second-year student in the MSPPM Flagship program. I have a deep-seated passion for uncovering stories hidden within data and translating complex datasets into clear and engaging visual narratives. 

I believe in the power of data visualization to bridge the gap between data and decision-making, and I'm constantly seeking to enhance my skills in this dynamic field and I'm excited about collaborating with my peers on exciting data-driven projects.

Feel free to connect with me and embark on this data storytelling journey together!

# What I Hope to Learn
Embarking on this academic journey, I want to equip myself with a comprehensive skill set in data visualization. Hereâ€™s a list of specific areas I am eager to delve into:

- **Mastering Data Visualization Tools**: Getting hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as Tableau, aiming to gain proficiency in utilizing these tools for various data visualization tasks.
- **Storytelling with Data**: Developing my ability to communicate complex data insights through compelling narratives, ensuring that my visualizations tell a clear and impactful story.
- **User-Centered Design**: Deepening my understanding of design thinking principles to create visualizations that are not only informative but also user-friendly, and applying good design practices in data visualization, including color theory, text placement, layout strategies, and selecting the appropriate type of visualization for different datasets.
- **Ethical Data Visualization**: Understanding the responsibilities that come with visualizing data, striving to ensure accuracy, fairness, and integrity in all my visual storytelling endeavors.

I am enthusiastic about the journey ahead and am committed to making the most out of this learning experience, striving to become a proficient and responsible data storyteller.

You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project.

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
