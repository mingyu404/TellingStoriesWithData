## Interview findings

| Questions                                                    | Interview 1: student, 20's                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| How familiar are you with the traffic collision trends in New York? | Barely know about the exact traffic collision stats of New York, however, I can infer the stats could be terrifying as New York City is super crowded with countless unreasonable traffic designs. |
| Is there anything in the story that prompts you to learn more or change your behavior regarding road safety? | I did not know following too closely actually can create much more traffic accidents than improper road design, which is assumed to be one fo the major problems of the traffic accidents by me.  I will definitely keep a longer distance than before. |
| Did the information presented change your perception of road safety in New York? | Yes, I was assuming New York City improves traffic control better than before. However, the death and injury rates are both increasing, which means the severity of traffic accidents has actually gotten worse in the past few years. |
| Were there any parts of the story or visualizations that were unclear or confusing? Were the visualizations clear and helpful in understanding the data? | ✅The colored geographical map is very helpful in identifying the severest streets in a very intuitive way. ❌ The histogram chart can be improved. Limit the number of years in the histogram. As there are 7 days in each year stands for 7 different colored histograms, adding too many year dimensions can make the chart very crowded, and not easy to follow the ideas behind the scenes. ❌In the colored geographical map, some words can be added to make the whole illustration more in-depth and give the reader more insights into the evolution of the whole data point. |
| How effective do you feel the storytelling narrative was? Were there any sections that you think should be expanded upon or condensed for clarity? | No, I think really nice.                                     |

| Questions                                                    | Interview 2, student 20's                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| How familiar are you with the traffic collision trends in New York? | Not quite familiar                                           |
| Is there anything in the story that prompts you to learn more or change your behavior regarding road safety? | The key takeaway for me is that the decrease in the number of road accidents would not necessarily result in a decrease in injuries and fatalities |
| Did the information presented change your perception of road safety in New York? | Previously I thought the road would be safer in Summer and less in Winter, but the data was vice versa. I have never noticed this issue before, it is really a reminder. |
| Were there any parts of the story or visualizations that were unclear or confusing? Were the visualizations clear and helpful in understanding the data? | ✅ Yes, very clear and helpful. ❌ The characters in the first two pics are a bit hard to read, and I suggest you merge the fatalities graph into the first picture. ❌ the histogram/bar charts are hard to read since they are small and crowded. |
| How effective do you feel the storytelling narrative was? Were there any sections that you think should be expanded upon or condensed for clarity? | The storytelling is very effective. ❌ I think it would be better if some measures could be proposed about how to improve road safety |

| Questions                                                    | Interview 3, student, 20's                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| How familiar are you with the traffic collision trends in New York? | I am not familiar with the traffic collision trends in New York at all. |
| Is there anything in the story that prompts you to learn more or change your behavior regarding road safety? | The fast-growing frequency of vehicle collisions during the last decade prompts me to attach more importance to road safety. |
| Did the information presented change your perception of road safety in New York? | Yes, the information clearly presents the current situation of vehicle collisions in New York. |
| Were there any parts of the story or visualizations that were unclear or confusing? Were the visualizations clear and helpful in understanding the data? | ✅ The visualizations are clear and helpful in understanding the data. There are charts and highlights of important data. ❌ The size of the first two visualizations is too small. ❌ the change of the data point on the map is not that obvious, maybe use different colors to distinguish the change or add some annotations. |
| How effective do you feel the storytelling narrative was? Were there any sections that you think should be expanded upon or condensed for clarity? | I feel the storytelling narrative is effective in presenting information as it is helpful in understanding data and learning facts. |

| Questions                                                    | Interview 4, data analyst working at Washington D.C., 20's|
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| How familiar are you with the traffic collision trends in New York? | Not very familiar. I have been to New York several times though. |
| Is there anything in the story that prompts you to learn more or change your behavior regarding road safety? | Absolutely. Need to be more conscious in peak hours.         |
| Did the information presented change your perception of road safety in New York? | Yes. Especially for roads with lots of people, such as Broadway and Brooklyn Express. I did not expect such an amount of accidents on Belt Parkway though. |
| Were there any parts of the story or visualizations that were unclear or confusing? Were the visualizations clear and helpful in understanding the data? | ✅ I think it is clear, fluent, and easy to understand. I really like the red dots on the map showing the number of accidents. ❌ the bar chart is a bit hard to read since there are many bars in total. ❌ I think maybe the call to action part could target your audience more, like proposing some suggestions for drivers/commuters/residents/individuals visiting NY. |
| How effective do you feel the storytelling narrative was? Were there any sections that you think should be expanded upon or condensed for clarity? | I think the storytelling part is very easy to follow.        |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                                           | Anticipated changes for Part III                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The problem with the first 2 visualizations: small and hard to read. | I plan to make it interactive and zoom bigger so that the audience will better understand these data. However, integrating the two charts presents a challenge due to the scale differences — one chart measures in thousands and the other in hundreds on the y-axis. |
| Problem with the map: add annotations or use different colors to show the change of the data point in the map more directly | I plan to add some annotations to the map so that the changes in the data points can be more evident to the audience. |
| Problem with bar charts of the weekly arc of accidents and seasonal variations: too crowded and hard to read. | I'm considering simplifying the bar charts by either condensing the number of years displayed or eliminating the yearly categorization, focusing solely on illustrating weekly and seasonal trends. This approach should make the data more accessible and the charts easier to interpret. |
| Problem with the call to action -- too general: some measures could be proposed about how to improve road safety / proposing some suggestions for the target audience. | I plan to expand the call to action/conclusion section a bit by adding potential measures and suggestions for my target audience based on the hourly, weekly, and seasonal patterns, and the top contributing factors to the vehicle collision in New York. This could make the focus of the storytelling more concentrated to my target audience. I think this recommendation is really helpful since it is true that currently, the conclusion part is too general. |
| Problem found with the critique group in class: the bar chart showing collision frequency on different street includes too many columns. | I plan to only include the top ten degerous street to enhance the readability. |
| Problem found with the critique group in class: better to sync the background color and the colors of visualizations. | I plan to change the colors of my visualizations or change the theme color. |

> Based on my interview result, I received consistent recommendations on the first two visualizations and the bar charts in terms of their readability. In terms of the storytelling narrative and the impact of the story, it seems that it is effective based on my sample size.
